### Links:
1. [OSP4DISS Website](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br>
It has most of the information you need for this course such as a step-by-step guide on how to complete weekly tasks.<br>
2. [OS10 Slides](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/)<br>
Useful slides that cover the entirety (I think?) of this course learning materials.<br>
3. [Pull and Push from/to GitHub](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/osp-114.html)<br>
I'm going to put this link here because I keep forgetting about it.
